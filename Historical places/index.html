         <h2 class="h"> Pyramids of Giza</h2>
         <p>The last surviving wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramids of Giza are one of the
            world's most recognizable landmarks.

            These tombs of the Pharaohs Cheops (Khufu), Chephren (Khafre), and Mycerinus (Menkaure), guarded by the
            enigmatic Sphinx, are usually top of most visitor's lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often
            the first sight they head to after landing.

         <p>Abu Simbel is an archaeological site in Egypt housing a series of incredible Ancient Egyptian monuments,
            especially a number of rock temples. The most famous sites at Abu Simbel are the two Temples of Ramesses II.

         <h2 class="h">Karnak Temple</h2>
         <p>The temple complex of Karnak is the largest religious building ever built, and was constructed over a span
            of 2,000 years. Construction started in the Old Kingdom and was continuously added to up until the Ptolemaic
            era, with approximately 30 different pharaohs contributing. It’s the second most visited site in Egypt after
            the Pyramids of Giza.</p>

         <h2 class="h">Valley of the Kings</h2>
         <p>In the former ancient Egyptian capital of Thebes (now modern-day Luxor in Upper Egypt), is the infamous
            Valley of the Kings. For a period of 500 years in the New Kingdom (1550 BC - 1069 BC), pharaohs were buried
            in rock-cut tombs in the Theban Hills, hidden from plain view. 62 tombs have been excavated to present day,
            with King Tut’s tomb being the most famous (but ironically, not the most impressive). Note: not all the
            tombs are open to the public, and some are on rotation.</p>

         <h2 class="h">Valley of the Queens</h2>
         <p>Nearby to the Valley of the Kings is the Valley of the Queens, where the wives of the pharaohs were buried
            during the same period. The main valley has 91 tombs discovered to date, and they’re generally smaller than
            the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. </p>

         <h2 class="h">Deir el Medina</h2>
         <p>This necropolis is often overlooked in favor of its more famous neighbors, the Valleys of the Kings and
            Queens, but you’d be doing yourself a huge disservice by not visiting Deir el Medina while in Luxor. Also
            known as the Valley of the Artisans, it’s home to the tombs of the artists, builders and craftsmen who
            worked on the tombs in the Valleys of the Kings and Queens.

         <h2 class="h">Coptic Cairo</h2>
         <p>The Cairo district known as Coptic Cairo is one of the most important Christian sites in the country.

            Originally the Fortress of Babylon, dating back to the Achaemenid Empire's conquest of Egypt in 525 BCE,
            this district is home to Cairo's oldest surviving church, synagogue, and mosque, as well as the excellent
            Coptic Museum, which holds the world's largest collection of Coptic Christian art and antiquities.

         <h2 class="h">Temple of Hathor at Dendera</h2>
         <p>Known for its still-startling blue more than 2,000 years later, the Temple of Hathor is the most impressive
            site at the temple complex at Dendera. Built in the Ptolemaic era, it shows Ancient Egyptian, Greek and
            Roman influences and has several shrines to different gods. It’s also known for the clear depictions of
            Cleopatra and her son Caeserion, fathered by Julius Caesar.

         <h2 class="h"> Deir el Bahri</h2>
         <p>Known primarily for the mortuary temple of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut of the New Kingdom, Deir el Bahri
            was originally chosen as the location for the mortuary temple of the pharaoh who founded the Middle Kingdom,
            Mentuhotep II.
