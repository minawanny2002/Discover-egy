         <h2 class="h">Visit The Pyramids of Giza</h2>
         <p>The last surviving wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramids of Giza are one of the
            world's most recognizable landmarks.

            These tombs of the Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx, are usually top of
            most visitor's lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often the first sight they head to after
            landing.

         <h2 class="h">Cruise The Nile River</h2>
         <p>Cruising the Nile is the most relaxing way to see the temples that stud the banks of the river on the route
            between Luxor and Aswan, plus sunrise and sunset over the date-palm-studded river banks, backed by sand
            dunes, is one of Egypt's most tranquil vistas.</p>

         <h2 class="h">Camp in the White Desert</h2>
         <p>The wind-sculpted chalk rock outcrops of White Desert National Park are the Western Desert region's most
            surreal landscapes and prime territory for desert camping trips under star-strewn skies. Trips can be
            organized in Bahariya Oasis, which is also the easiest oasis to reach from Cairo.</p>

         <h2 class="h">Kiteboard in El Gouna</h2>
         <p>Just north of Hurghada, on Egypt's Red Sea coast, the purpose-built resort town of El Gouna has become a
            major water sports center. Near constant winds offshore mean El Gouna is prime territory for kiteboarding
            and now several operators in town offer kiteboarding lessons. </p>

         <h2 class="h">Explore the Thistlegorm Wreck</h2>
         <p>There are plenty of wrecks off the Red Sea coast to explore but the most famous is the Thistlegorm, Although
            it is possible to day trip to the site by boat, due to the travel time, the best way to dive here is by
            liveaboard (overnight boat trips), which allow you more time at the site. </p>

         <h2 class="h">Diving the Red Sea</h2>
         <p>Below the Red Sea's surface is another world as fascinating as the temples and tombs on land.

            The coral reefs of the Red Sea are renowned among scuba divers for both the soft corals on display and the
            vast amount of sea life, ranging from colorful reef fish and nudibranchs, to sharks, dolphins, turtles,
            rays, and even dugongs.
